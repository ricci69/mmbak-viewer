# mmbak file viewer
Simple PHP library to open and navigate through the content of a mmbak file.

mmbak files are the backup of [Money Manager APP](https://realbyteapps.com/) (a wonderful personal finance app that I recommend you try).
\

\
&nbsp;
## Why this repository
The purpose of this library is only to view the contents of an mmbak file from a browser, and not to replace the native APP. For this reason there will be no functions to modify the data.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
## TODO
In the near future the PHP library will be supported by a web interface to better visualize the data.
